    <main>
        <h2>The basics</h2>

          <p>First <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">fork</a> one of our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Coin-Catalog/repositories">many repositories</a>. Then it is preferred that you make a new branch. Then make whatever changes you would like to make! After going to <code>https://github.com/Coin-Catalog/Repository name</code>. Then click the button that says <code>Compare & pull request</code>¹. Then you have opened your PR! Now, don't get too happy yet. Your PR will go through at least 1 round of reviews before it is merged into the <code>main</code> branch. The reason you need to stay active is because people may request changes to be made and you will need to either commit the changes or say why you think that is not a good change and we can discuss it.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>¹That button is in this yellow box shown in the image below.</p>

          <h2>Good ways to start</h2>
            
          <h3>ISSUES!</h3>
            
          <p>Issues are a great way to know what you should do! You can ask to be assigned to any issue if somebody has not been <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users">assigned</a> to the issue yet. You can view a list of the issue pages below.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/Coin-Catalog/Coin-catalog.github.io/issues">Issues</a> for the 99% of the website</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/Coin-Catalog/Contributing">Issues</a> for the <code>Contributing</code> repository</li>           
            </ul>

          <h3>Typos</h3>
        
            <p>Typos, spelling mistakes and grammer mistakes will always slip by sometimes. So if you see something wrong with it open a PR to fix it and it will be merged very quickly.</p>
