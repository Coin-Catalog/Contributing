        <h2>Good ways to start</h2>
          
        <h3>ISSUES!</h3>
          
        <p>Issues are a great way to know what you should do! You can ask to be assigned to any issue if somebody has not been <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users">assigned</a> to the issue yet. You can view a list of the issue pages below.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Coin-Catalog/Coin-catalog.github.io/issues">Issues</a> for the <code>Coin-catalog.github.io</code> repository</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Coin-Catalog/pennies/issues">Issues</a> for the <code>pennies</code> repository</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Coin-Catalog/Contributing">Issues</a> for the <code>Contributing</code> repository</li>           
          </ul>

        <h3>Typos</h3>
      
          <p>Typos, spelling mistakes and grammer mistakes will always slip by sometimes. So if you see something wrong with it open a PR to fix it and it will be merged very quickly.</p>
